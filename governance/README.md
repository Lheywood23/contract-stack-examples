# Governance

This folder documents how contracts are frozen, reviewed, and evolved.

Governance here is not about compliance theatre.
It is about making violations mechanically visible.

What lives here:

- freeze criteria
- regression gates
- change control rules
- precedence definitions

Governance exists so future intelligence cannot reinterpret original intent.
