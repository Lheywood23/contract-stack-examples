# Contract Stack Examples

## 🧭 Why Governance Matters

In complex AI systems, most failures don’t come from bad code.  
They come from **drift** — when purpose, boundaries, and expectations slowly erode over time.

This repository treats **governance as the backbone of coherence**:
formal contracts, invariants, and guardrails that keep systems aligned to their governing intent even under pressure.

This repository contains **worked examples** of AI contract design.

It is not an AI system.
It is not a framework.
It is not a product.

It is a collection of artifacts that show how I design boundaries, constraints, and governance
so AI systems remain coherent under consequence.

Everything here is intentionally boring.
If something looks impressive, it’s probably out of scope.

The goal is simple:
make intent explicit enough that failure becomes informative.
