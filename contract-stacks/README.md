# Contract Stacks

This folder contains **example contract stacks**.

Each stack shows how a specific boundary or capability is constrained so it cannot
expand accidentally, optimistically, or implicitly.

These are not full systems.
They are not meant to run.
They are meant to be inspected.

If you are looking for prompts, agents, workflows, or automation —
this is the wrong place.

This is where behavior is limited before it is enabled.
